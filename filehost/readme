To use my filehost, please run these simple steps.

(assuming you have NODEJS installed already)

First, run in your console "npm i express fs"

then CD into the same folder as "server.js", and run in your console "node ./server.js"

This can only be used with a POST request at the moment.

Post usage is in JSON like this:

{
    'whatever': 'contents that should be saved to .txt file'
}

Thank you for using my filehost!
