# Project Title : Zeno

Covid-19 resulted in significant geographical shifts in global supply and demand, which in turn has created problems for finely tuned global supply chains. Project Zeno is **a solution for complex and fragmented supply chain** issues created by disrupted market.

It utilizes the **Ethereum blockchain network and cloud off-chain databases** to provide effective gas pricing. Zeno provides an easy-to-use interface to manage inventory and connect with various parties throughout the supply chain journey, such as transportation providers and retailers. Products are tracked using a unique **Certificate of Origin**, ensuring transparency and traceability. 

Throughout the project, our team has reviewed existing digital solutions for supply chain management and developed a new solution that addresses identified issues. We have implemented automation for complex functions such as **releasing payments, recording ledger entries, and flagging exceptions** that require manual intervention through the use of **smart contracts**. This allows for verification of contractual obligations and streamlined payment issuance. It's important to note that blockchain technology is **not meant to replace existing ERP systems but to interface with them across participating firms** to enhance the efficiency, transparency and security of the supply chain.

However, We still face challenges in linking digital and physical systems, ensuring control, security, and privacy, and cultural adoption. Project Zeno serves as a generic framework that can be adapted to address specific issues in any domain.
