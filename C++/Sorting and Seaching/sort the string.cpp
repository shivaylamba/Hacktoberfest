/*Nishant is a very naughty boy in Launchpad Batch. One day he was playing with strings, and randomly shuffled them all. Your task is to help Nishant Sort all
 the strings ( lexicographically ) but if a string is present completely as a prefix in another string,then string with longer length should come first.
  Eg bat, batman are 2 strings and the string bat is present as a prefix in Batman - then sorted order should have - Batman, bat.

Input Format
N(integer) followed by N strings.

Constraints
N<=1000

Output Format
N lines each containing one string.

Sample Input
3
bat
apple
batman
Sample Output
apple
batman
bat
Explanation
In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, dictionary order, alphabetical order or lexicographic(al) product) is a
 generalization of the way words are alphabetically ordered based on the alphabetical order of their component letters.*/
