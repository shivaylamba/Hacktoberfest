You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just merge it ;)
Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site)
Do NOT remove other content.
Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works

Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts
