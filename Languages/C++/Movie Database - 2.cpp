/* 10/13/2020 
The program will read a file database for movies and store all the info
into a dynamically allocated struct

It will then allow the user to search for a movie within the database
the search will not be case sensitive

If the movie is found it will be displayed and will prompt the user
if they want to save it. If they choose to save it will be saved into
a file called favorites.txt. After all of this the user will be prompted
if they want to continue with the program.

If the movie was not found, an error message will be displayed.*/
