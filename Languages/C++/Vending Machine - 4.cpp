simulates a simple vending machine that sellschips, candy, and soda. Each of 
these snacks has a different price and will have a different amount in stock. 
When the program is running, the current contents of the vending machine will
be displayed to the user, and then a prompt to enter a number of quarters will
appear. After the user enters a number, the amount of money they entered will 
appear in dollars and cents. For example, if the user entered 7 quarters, $1.75
would be displayed. Next, the user will be prompted to make a selection from 
the vending machine. If they have entered enough money and the snack is 
in-stock, the item will be dispensed, and the number in-stock will decrease by
one. If the user entered more money than necessary to make the purchase, a 
message will be displayed indicated that the appropriate amount of change has
been returned.
