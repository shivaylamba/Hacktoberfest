/*We will be creating a program that simulates a simple memory game.In this memory game, a grid of face
down cards is created.Every element of the grid has a matching pair.The user's goal is to find the
location of all pairs.For example,
1 4 3
2 3 1
4 2 5
6 6 5
For every iteration of a loop, the grid is displayed, and the user is prompted to enter two coordinates; x
and y.where x is for rowand y is for column.
For example, the coordinates could be(row, column) and start at 0.
(0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2)
(1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2)
(2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 2)
(3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2)
Once the coordinates are entered, the two cards at the corresponding coordinates will be compared to each
other
1) If the cards match each other, the user has found a pair, so we keep them flipped over
2) If the cards do not match, we temporarily show the user the values of the cards at the coordinates,
and then we flip the cards over again
This loop should continue until the user finds all the pairs, or until they choose to quit.
