/* 

This Program will save a student's information at a school and print it out

The Program will save the number of students in the system, the student's name, 
the number of tests each student has taken, and the scores they got for each test
(Even if the number of tests each student has taken differs from each other the 
program will be able to save the scores and output it correctly)

The Program will output all the data entered by the user in the following format:

There are (# of students) students in the system
   
Name of student #1: SAMPLE NAME
Grades of student #1: 99 99 99 99
   
Name of student #2: SAMPLE2 NAME2
Grades of student #2: 99 99 99 99
   
etc....
